# Copy2AmiClip
Copy clipboard on Mac, Windows or Linux to Amiga over network
## About
When I started to revive my Amiga I often had the situation that I researched things on my modern computer (a Mac in my case) that I would have liked to transfer quickly to my Amiga.
Things like code snippets, URLs ... . Always writing them to a file and transferring via FTP or even typing was tedious and error-prone. So I thought a cross-device copy and paste would be nice. Just like I knew it from my Apple devices.
That's how Copy2AmiClip was born. At first only as a DOS script, now as an AREXX script on the Amiga side. On the modern side I have scrips in Python and Shell. Actually designed and tested only on MacOS. But it's easy to make the run on Windows or Linux as well.
